        "body": "Fixed\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- A bug that allowed classes defined in the global scope of the startup script and recognized as\r\n  ``bluesky.protocols.Movable``, ``Readable`` or ``Flyable`` (e.g. ``ophyd.Device``) to be\r\n  included in the list of existing devices. Only instantiated class objects are currently\r\n  included in the list.\r\n\r\n- A deficiency in the code that loads Python scripts (not startup scripts from the folder\r\n  as in IPython ``profile_collection``) into the environment that failed to load scripts containing\r\n  definitions of devices with components.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- Support for passing subdevice names as values of plan parameters.\r\n\r\n- Support for regular expressions in the lists of names defined in ``plans``\r\n  and ``devices`` sections of ``parameter_annotation_decorator``. Keywords ``__MOTOR__``,\r\n  ``__DETECTOR__``, ``__READABLE__`` or ``__FLYABLE__`` can be used in conjunction with\r\n  regular expression to select device of the respective types.\r\n\r\n- New boolean parameters of the plan parameter annotation (``convert_plan_names``\r\n  and ``convert_device_names``) for explicitly enabling/disabling conversion of names\r\n  of plans and/or devices passed as parameter values. Setting those parameters\r\n  overrides the default behavior and should be used with caution.\r\n\r\n- Support for subdevice names in **'user_group_permissions.yaml'**.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanged\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- The algorithm for processing of user group permissions has changed. The old\r\n  **'user_group_permissions.yaml'** may no longer work as expected. If the stock\r\n  **'user_group_permissions.yaml'** is used for the project, replace it with\r\n  the updated file from the repository. Otherwise update the existing file\r\n  using following guidelines:\r\n\r\n  - If the project uses custom **'user_group_permissions.yaml'**, then insert ``:``\r\n    before each regular expression in the lists (e.g. change ``\"^count\"`` to\r\n    ``\":^count\"``, ``\"^det\"`` to ``\":^det\"`` etc.).\r\n  - In previous versions, only the lists with regular expressions were supported.\r\n    Now the lists may include explicitly listed plan, device or subdevice names,\r\n    such as ``\"count\"``, ``\"det1\"``, ``\"det1.val\"`` (there is no need to use regular\r\n    expressions such as ``\":^count$\"`` to allow the plan ``count``).\r\n  - The supported patterns allow to control which subdevices are included. For example,\r\n    the pattern ``:^det`` includes all devices with names starting with ``det``,\r\n    but no subdevices. The pattern ``\":^det:?.*\"`` selects all subdevices with\r\n    unlimited depth. Patterns may include the parameter ``depth`` that limits\r\n    maximum depth for subdevices, for example ``\":^det:?.*:depth=2\"`` adds\r\n    subdevices and subdevices of subdevices. See\r\n    `Configuring User Group Permissions\r\n    <https://blueskyproject.io/bluesky-queueserver/features_and_config.html#configuring-user-group-permissions>`_\r\n    for more detailed instructions.\r\n\r\nRemoved\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Built-in types ``AllDetectors``, ``AllMotors``, ``AllFlyers`` and ``AllPlans`` can no\r\n  longer be used in parameter annotations of defined in ``parameter_annotation_decorator``.\r\n  Use regular expressions in conjunction with keywords ``__MOTOR__``, ``__DETECTOR__``,\r\n  ``__READABLE__`` or ``__FLYABLE__`` to create lists of devices of respective types.\r\n  Use built-in types ``__PLAN__``, ``__DEVICE__``, ``__PLAN_OR_DEVICE__`` in parameter\r\n  annotations to selectively enable conversion of names for all plans and/or\r\n  devices without creating lists of names. Alternatively, use ``convert_plan_names``\r\n  or ``convert_device_names`` parameters of the annotation in order to explicitly\r\n  enable/disable conversion of all plan/device names.\r\n",

        "body": "Fixed\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- Numerous fixes related to reliability of Queue Server operation.\r\n\r\n- Implemented changes to make Queue Server compatible with ``aioredis`` v2.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- The new ``--update-existing-plans-devices`` CLI parameter of ``start-re-manager`` was added that\r\n  controls when the file that stores existing plans and devices is updated.\r\n\r\n- A new parameter of ``permissions_reload`` 0MQ API: ``reload_plans_devices`` (boolean, the default\r\n  value is ``False``). If set ``True``, the parameter forces RE Manager to load the list of\r\n  existing plans and devices from the disk file. The API may be called with ``reload_plans_devices=True``\r\n  using ``qserver`` CLI tool as ``qserver permissions reload lists``.\r\n\r\n- A new parameter of ``permissions_reload`` 0MQ API: ``reload_permissions`` (boolean, the default\r\n  value is ``True``). If ``True``, permissions are reloaded from the disk file (if allowed), otherwise\r\n  the currently used permissions are used in computations.\r\n\r\n- Extended the number of states of worker environment. Currently used states include ``initializing``,\r\n  ``idle``, ``executing_plan``, ``executing_task``, ``closing``, ``closed``.\r\n\r\n- A new status fields (``status`` 0MQ API): ``worker_environment_state``, ``worker_background_tasks``,\r\n  ``task_results_uid``, ``plans_existing_uid``, ``devices_existing_uid``.\r\n\r\n- Extended the number of sections in specification of user group permissions (e.g. in\r\n  ``user_group_permissions.yaml`` file). The new sections (``allowed_functions`` and ``forbidden_functions``)\r\n  define conditions for names of functions that are accessible using ``function_execute`` API by users\r\n  from each user groups.\r\n\r\n- New 0MQ API: ``script_upload``, ``function_execute``, ``task_result``, ``plans_existing``,\r\n  ``devices_existing``. CLI implementation: ``qserver script upload`` (``script_upload`` API),\r\n  ``qserver function execute`` (``function_execute`` API), ``qserver task result`` (``task_result`` API),\r\n  ``qserver existing devices`` (``devices_existing`` API), ``qserver existing plans`` (``plans_existing`` API).\r\n\r\n- A new 0MQ API: ``permissions_set`` and ``permissions_get`` that allow uploading and downloading\r\n  user group permissions. CLI support for the new API: ``qserver permissions set <fln.yaml>`` and\r\n  ``qserver permissions get``.\r\n\r\n- A new parameter of ``start-re-manager`` CLI tool: ``--user-group-permissions-reload``. The parameter accepts\r\n  values ``NEVER``, ``ON_REQUEST`` and ``ON_STARTUP``.\r\n\r\n- A new section in documentation on management of user group permissions.\r\n\r\nChanged\r\n-------\r\n\r\n- Refactoring of the code for management of user group permissions and lists of existing and\r\n  allowed plans and devices to make it more consistent. The identical lists of user permissions\r\n  and existing plans and devices are now maintained by worker and manager processes.\r\n\r\n- The lists of existing plans and devices used by RE Manager (both manager and worker processes)\r\n  is automatically updated each time plans and devices in are changed in RE namespace (currently\r\n  RE namespace is changed only when a new worker environment is opened).\r\n\r\n- All sections for user group permissions are now optional. The ``forbidden_plans``,\r\n  ``forbidden_devices`` and ``forbidden_functions`` sections could be skipped if there are\r\n  no forbidden items that need to be excluded. Skipping ``allowed_...`` section disables all\r\n  items (plans, devices or functions) for the group, e.g. if ``allowed_plans`` is skipped,\r\n  users from this group will not be able to submit or run any plans. Since rules for\r\n  the ``root`` group are applied to the lists accessible by users from all other groups,\r\n  skipping ``allowed_plans`` for ``root`` disables all plans for all other groups.\r\n",

This setting was previously supported but support was removed (years ago). We now view its removal as a mistake.\r\n* When area detector takes a series of images and num_capture is set to 0, this is now interpreted to mean \u201chowever many images the detector is configured to acquire\u201d rather than \u201c0 images\u201d.\r\n* Fixed EigerDetectorCam\u2019s photon_energy component\u2019s PV suffix spelling.\r\n* Motor limits HLS and LLS used EpicsSignal when they should be using EpicsSignalRO.\r\n* EpicsSignal with string=True kwarg now correctly results in dtype='string' from .describe() method\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n* Support for Emergent Vision detectors.\r\n* The class-wide default for write_timeout is now configurable via EpicsSignalBase.set_defaults(). It was previously only configurable on a per-instance basis at initialization time, with the class-wide default hard-coded to None. The class-wide default is still None, unchanged from the previous release.\r\n* The class-wide default for auto_monitor is now configurable via EpicsSignalBase.set_defaults(). It was previously configurable on a per-instance basis at initialization time. The default value, False, has not changed.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* The logging has been tweaked to be less noisy, particularly at import time. Some log messages have been moved from 'ophyd.object' to 'ophyd.control_layer', and the level of messages emitted to 'ophyd.control_layer' have been reduced from INFO to DEBUG. Some log messages have been removed entirely.\r\n* The method EpicsSignalBase.set_default_timeout() has been renamed to EpicsSignalBase.set_defaults() because it has been extended to include more than timeouts, as described above. The old name is still supported but issues a warning that it may be removed in the future.\r\n* Use auto-monitoring in more places in EpicsMotor. This should drastically speed up motor.read_configuration().\r\n* Update ophyd.sim.MockFlyer to use its name as its stream name.\r\n* Capture the create_directory signal on Area Detector FilePlugin as configuration.",

        "body": "## Features\r\n* When used with ophyd v1.2.0 or later, emit Resource and Datum documents through the RunEngine. Previously, ophyd would insert these documents directly into a database. This left other consumers with only partial information (for example, missing file paths to externally-stored data) and no guarantees around synchronization. Now, ophyd need not interact with a database directly. All information flows through the RunEngine and out to any subscribed consumers in a deterministic order.\r\n* New Msg commands, install_suspender and remove_suspender, allow plans to temporarily add and remove Suspenders.\r\n* The RunEngine\u2019s signal handling (i.e. Ctrl+C capturing) is now configurable. The RunEngine accepts a list of context_managers that it will enter and exit before and after running. By default, it has one context manager that handles Ctrl+C. To disable Ctrl+C handling, pass in an empty list instead. This can also be used to inject other custom behavior.\r\n* Add new plans: x2x_scan(), spiral_square_plan(), and rel_spiral_square_plan().\r\n* Add convenience methods for reviewing the available commands, commands() and print_command_registry().\r\n* Add a crossings attribute to PeakStats.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* When resuming after a suspender, call resume() on all devices (if present).\r\n* Fixed BEC LiveGrid plot for a motor with one step.\r\n* A codepath in LiveFit that should have produced a warning produced an error instead.\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* User-defined callbacks subscribed to the RunEngine 'all' stream must accept documents with names 'resource', 'datum' and 'bulk_datum'. It does not necessarily have to heed their contents, but it must not fall over if it receives one.\r\n## Deprecations\r\n* The IPython \u201cmagics\u201d, always marked as experimental, have been reworked. Instead of relying on the singleton lists, BlueskyMagics.positioners and BlueskyMagics.detectors, the magics now scrape the user namespace for objects that implement the _ophyd_labels_ interface. See IPython \u2018Magics\u2019 [Experimental] for the new usage. The magics will revert to their old behavior if the singleton lists are non-empty, but they will produce a warning.

Also, include sub-second precision.\r\n* Avoid situation where plan without hints caused the BestEffortCallback to error instead of do its best to guess useful behavior.\r\n* Skip un-filled externally-stored data in LiveTable. This fixes a bug where it is expecting array data but gets UUID (datum_id) and errors out.\r\n## Deprecations\r\nThe caching_repeater() plan has been deprecated because it is incompatible with some preprocessors.

        "body": "This release fixes small bugs in v1.0.0 and introduces one new feature. The API changes or deprecations are not expected to affect many users.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n* Add a new command to the [RunEngine](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/run_engine_api.html#bluesky.run_engine.RunEngine), `'drop'`, which jettisons the currently active event bundle without saving. This is useful for workflows that generate many readings that can immediately be categorized as not useful by the plan and summarily discarded.\r\n* Add `install_kicker()`, which dispatches automatically to `install_qt_kicker()` or `install_nb_kicker()` depending on the current matplotlib backend.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fix the hint for [inner_product_scan()](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/generated/bluesky.plans.inner_product_scan.html#bluesky.plans.inner_product_scan), which previously used a default hint that was incorrect.\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n* In [tune_centroid()](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/generated/bluesky.plans.tune_centroid.html#bluesky.plans.tune_centroid), change the meaning of the `step_factor` parameter to be the factor to reduce the range of each successive iteration. Enforce bounds on the motion, and determine the centroid from each pass separately.\r\n* The [SupplementalData](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/plans.html#bluesky.preprocessors.SupplementalData) preprocessor inserts its instructions in a more logical order: first baseline readings, then monitors, then flyers. Previously, the order was reversed.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n* The suspender `SuspendInBand` has been renamed to [SuspendWhenOutsideBand](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/generated/bluesky.suspenders.SuspendWhenOutsideBand.html#bluesky.suspenders.SuspendWhenOutsideBand) to make its meaning more clear. Its behavior has not changed: it suspends when a value exits a given range. The original, confusing name now issues a warning.\r\n* The suspender `SuspendOutBand`, which counter-intuitively suspends when a value enters a given range, has been deprecated. (If some application is found for this unusual scenario, the user can always implement a custom suspender to handle it.)",
