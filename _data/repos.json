        "body": "## Features\r\n* When used with ophyd v1.2.0 or later, emit Resource and Datum documents through the RunEngine. Previously, ophyd would insert these documents directly into a database. This left other consumers with only partial information (for example, missing file paths to externally-stored data) and no guarantees around synchronization. Now, ophyd need not interact with a database directly. All information flows through the RunEngine and out to any subscribed consumers in a deterministic order.\r\n* New Msg commands, install_suspender and remove_suspender, allow plans to temporarily add and remove Suspenders.\r\n* The RunEngine\u2019s signal handling (i.e. Ctrl+C capturing) is now configurable. The RunEngine accepts a list of context_managers that it will enter and exit before and after running. By default, it has one context manager that handles Ctrl+C. To disable Ctrl+C handling, pass in an empty list instead. This can also be used to inject other custom behavior.\r\n* Add new plans: x2x_scan(), spiral_square_plan(), and rel_spiral_square_plan().\r\n* Add convenience methods for reviewing the available commands, commands() and print_command_registry().\r\n* Add a crossings attribute to PeakStats.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* When resuming after a suspender, call resume() on all devices (if present).\r\n* Fixed BEC LiveGrid plot for a motor with one step.\r\n* A codepath in LiveFit that should have produced a warning produced an error instead.\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n* User-defined callbacks subscribed to the RunEngine 'all' stream must accept documents with names 'resource', 'datum' and 'bulk_datum'. It does not necessarily have to heed their contents, but it must not fall over if it receives one.\r\n## Deprecations\r\n* The IPython \u201cmagics\u201d, always marked as experimental, have been reworked. Instead of relying on the singleton lists, BlueskyMagics.positioners and BlueskyMagics.detectors, the magics now scrape the user namespace for objects that implement the _ophyd_labels_ interface. See IPython \u2018Magics\u2019 [Experimental] for the new usage. The magics will revert to their old behavior if the singleton lists are non-empty, but they will produce a warning.

        "body": "This release fixes small bugs in v1.0.0 and introduces one new feature. The API changes or deprecations are not expected to affect many users.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n* Add a new command to the [RunEngine](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/run_engine_api.html#bluesky.run_engine.RunEngine), `'drop'`, which jettisons the currently active event bundle without saving. This is useful for workflows that generate many readings that can immediately be categorized as not useful by the plan and summarily discarded.\r\n* Add `install_kicker()`, which dispatches automatically to `install_qt_kicker()` or `install_nb_kicker()` depending on the current matplotlib backend.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n* Fix the hint for [inner_product_scan()](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/generated/bluesky.plans.inner_product_scan.html#bluesky.plans.inner_product_scan), which previously used a default hint that was incorrect.\r\n\r\n## API Changes\r\n* In [tune_centroid()](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/generated/bluesky.plans.tune_centroid.html#bluesky.plans.tune_centroid), change the meaning of the `step_factor` parameter to be the factor to reduce the range of each successive iteration. Enforce bounds on the motion, and determine the centroid from each pass separately.\r\n* The [SupplementalData](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/plans.html#bluesky.preprocessors.SupplementalData) preprocessor inserts its instructions in a more logical order: first baseline readings, then monitors, then flyers. Previously, the order was reversed.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n* The suspender `SuspendInBand` has been renamed to [SuspendWhenOutsideBand](http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/generated/bluesky.suspenders.SuspendWhenOutsideBand.html#bluesky.suspenders.SuspendWhenOutsideBand) to make its meaning more clear. Its behavior has not changed: it suspends when a value exits a given range. The original, confusing name now issues a warning.\r\n* The suspender `SuspendOutBand`, which counter-intuitively suspends when a value enters a given range, has been deprecated. (If some application is found for this unusual scenario, the user can always implement a custom suspender to handle it.)",

This setting was previously supported but support was removed (years ago). We now view its removal as a mistake.\r\n* When area detector takes a series of images and num_capture is set to 0, this is now interpreted to mean \u201chowever many images the detector is configured to acquire\u201d rather than \u201c0 images\u201d.\r\n* Fixed EigerDetectorCam\u2019s photon_energy component\u2019s PV suffix spelling.\r\n* Motor limits HLS and LLS used EpicsSignal when they should be using EpicsSignalRO.\r\n* EpicsSignal with string=True kwarg now correctly results in dtype='string' from .describe() method\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n* Support for Emergent Vision detectors.\r\n* The class-wide default for write_timeout is now configurable via EpicsSignalBase.set_defaults(). It was previously only configurable on a per-instance basis at initialization time, with the class-wide default hard-coded to None. The class-wide default is still None, unchanged from the previous release.\r\n* The class-wide default for auto_monitor is now configurable via EpicsSignalBase.set_defaults(). It was previously configurable on a per-instance basis at initialization time. The default value, False, has not changed.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* The logging has been tweaked to be less noisy, particularly at import time. Some log messages have been moved from 'ophyd.object' to 'ophyd.control_layer', and the level of messages emitted to 'ophyd.control_layer' have been reduced from INFO to DEBUG. Some log messages have been removed entirely.\r\n* The method EpicsSignalBase.set_default_timeout() has been renamed to EpicsSignalBase.set_defaults() because it has been extended to include more than timeouts, as described above. The old name is still supported but issues a warning that it may be removed in the future.\r\n* Use auto-monitoring in more places in EpicsMotor. This should drastically speed up motor.read_configuration().\r\n* Update ophyd.sim.MockFlyer to use its name as its stream name.\r\n* Capture the create_directory signal on Area Detector FilePlugin as configuration.",
